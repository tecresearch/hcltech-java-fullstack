Common Use Case in Spring Boot
==============================
1)User logs in with username/password.

2)Spring Boot validates credentials and generates a JWT.

3)JWT is sent back to the client.

4)For each subsequent request, the client includes the JWT in the header.

5)Spring Security filters decode and validate the JWT to allow access.
