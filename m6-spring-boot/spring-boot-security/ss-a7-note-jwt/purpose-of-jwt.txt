Purpose of JWT in Spring Boot Security
======================================
1)Stateless Authentication

Unlike traditional session-based authentication (where the server keeps a session per user), JWTs allow authentication to be stateless. Once the server generates the token, it doesn't need to remember anything about the user — all the info is inside the token itself.

2)Compact and Self-Contained

A JWT contains user identity and possibly roles or permissions. It’s self-contained, so it carries all the necessary data to authenticate a user

3)Authorization

After a user logs in and receives a JWT, they include it in the Authorization header of subsequent requests:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

4)Cross-Service Communication

In microservices, JWTs are ideal for authenticating requests between services without managing sessions centrally.
