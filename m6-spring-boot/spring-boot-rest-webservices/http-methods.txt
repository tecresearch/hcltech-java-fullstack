HTTP methods
============
HTTP methods (also known as HTTP verbs) define the actions that can be performed on a given resource/data in a web application. Here are the most common HTTP methods:

1)GET – Retrieves resource/data from the server.
2)POST – Sends data to the server to create a new resource.
3)PUT – Updates an existing resource or creates one if it does not exist.
4)DELETE – Removes a resource from the server.
5)PATCH – Partially updates an existing resource.
etc
On client application/front-end requirement you will have to build RESTFul APIs for aove methods

RESTFul APIs supports both JSON and XML data-exchnage format

<User>
    <id>1</id>
    <name>John Doe</name>

</User>
