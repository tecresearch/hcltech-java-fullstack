Web Services
=============
Like web application, web services run on web server
Methods of these services are remotely called by client application over web.These methods are known as APIs
Any client application(Angular application, ReactJS application, .Net appplication, Python application, Java application,etc)can access web services

Web services in Spring Boot allow applications to communicate over the web using standardized protocols like HTTP. Spring Boot simplifies the development of web services by providing built-in support for RESTful and SOAP-based services.

Types of Web Services in Spring Boot
====================================

1)RESTful Web Services (REST API)
  REST stands for representational state transfer
  a)Based on HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH,etc)
  b)Uses JSON or XML for data exchange
  c)Lightweight and stateless
  d)Implemented using @RestController in Spring Boot
  etc  

2)SOAP Web Services
SOAP stands for simple object access protocol
  a)Uses XML messages over HTTP
  b)More standardized but heavier than REST
  c)Implemented using Spring Web Services (Spring-WS)
