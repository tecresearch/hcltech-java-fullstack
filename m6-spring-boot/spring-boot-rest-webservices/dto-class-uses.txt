DTO class
===========
In Spring Boot REST APIs, a DTO (Data Transfer Object) is used to transfer data between layers (e.g., between the controller and service layer) without exposing internal entities. It helps in:

1)Encapsulation: Hiding internal entity details.
2)Validation: Ensuring only valid data is processed.
3)Performance: Reducing unnecessary data transfer.
A DTO class typically contains only fields and getters/setters.
