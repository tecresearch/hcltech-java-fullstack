@RestController
==============

@RestController is a Spring Boot annotation used to create RESTful web services. It is a specialized version of @Controller, combining it with @ResponseBody, which means that methods in a class annotated with @RestController will return data/resource directly as JSON or XML instead of rendering a view.

Resource in RESTFul web sevrer
==============================
In a RESTful API built using Spring Boot, a resource refers to an entity or an object that can be accessed via an endpoint. Each resource is typically represented by a Java class (often called an entity, model, or 
DTO) and is exposed through a controller that handles HTTP requests.

Endpoint
===========
An endpoint is a specific URL where an API can be accessed. It represents a resource (such as users, products, or orders) and is used to send or receive data.

If entity class is User then

HTTP Method	Endpoint			Action
-----------     --------			-------
GET		/users				Retrieve a list of users
GET		/users/{id}			Retrieve a specific user
POST		/users				Create a new user
PUT		/users/{id}			Update a userâ€™s information
PATCH		/users/{id}			Partially update a user
DELETE		/users/{id}			Delete a user
