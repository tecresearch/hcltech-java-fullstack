Spring boot framework
=====================
Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of Spring applications by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), and production-ready features out of the box. It minimizes boilerplate code, making it easier to build stand-alone, production-grade applications.

2)Does not support XML-vased configuration
3)Spring starter dependency
4)It has embeded web server.Default web server is Tomcat
5)Spring boot cli
6)Standalone application.Every project of spring boot has main class
