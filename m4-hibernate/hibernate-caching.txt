Hibernate caching
===================
Hibernate caching helps improve the performance of the hibernate application by reducing numer of database accesses/hits
Hibernate keeps persistent object into cache to improve application performance.If an object will be accesed by the application multiple times then database will be hit only once
Hibernate provides two levels of caching
1)First-level Cache(Session cache)
2)Second-level Cache(SessionFactory cache)

First-level Cache
=================
It is associated with Hibernate Session and enabled by default
All persisted objects are kept into first-level cache by Hibernate
Each Hibernate Session maintains separate first-level cache
First level cache is destoyed when Hibernate Session is closed
This cache is used to reduce number of SQL queries.Hibernate provides object to the application from first-level cache

Second-level Cache(SessionFactory cache)
=========================================
This cache is required when application is creating and using more than one Hibernate Session
This cache will be associated with Hibernate SessionFactory
Objects kept into second-level cache can be accessed by every Hibernate Session

How to use second-level cache into project?
===========================================
1)Configure dependency of this cache into pom.xml
2)Configure implemntation of this cache into cfg file and enable it
3)Set cache concurrency strategy into entity class
