Association Mapping
===================
If object of a class is associated with object of another class then there will be association between both object and between entity class of both object
We need to map this association.This mapping could be of following four types
1)One to one mapping
2)One to many mapping
3)Many to one mapping
4)Many to many mapping


One to one mapping
------------------
One instance of first entity is associated with one instance of second entity.Similarly one instance of second entity is associated with one instance of first entity

One to many mapping
-------------------
One instance of first entity is associated with multiple instances of second entity.But one instance of second entity is associated with one instance of first entity

Many to one mapping
-------------------
One instance of first entity is associated with one instance of second entity.But one instance of second entity is associated with multiple instances of first entity

Many to many mapping
-------------------
One instance of first entity is associated with multiple instances of second entity.Similalry one instance of second entity is associated with multiple instances of first entity
