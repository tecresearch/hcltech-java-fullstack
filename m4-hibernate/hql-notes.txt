HQL(Hibernate query language)
=============================
By using this language we can write queries
This query should be written for persistent/entity class
We need to give this query to the object of Query interface
We need to call/invoke method of this interface to execute HQL
Query<T> query=session.createQuery("from EntityClassName",);
