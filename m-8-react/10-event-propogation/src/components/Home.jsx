    React follows the standard DOM event propagation model, which includes three phases:

// üîÅ Event Propagation Phases
// Capturing Phase (also called "trickling down"):

// The event starts from the root and travels down to the target element.
// In React, you can listen to this phase using onClickCapture, onMouseDownCapture, etc.
// Target Phase:

// The event reaches the target element (the one that was actually interacted with).
// Bubbling Phase:

// The event bubbles up from the target element back to the root.
// This is the default phase React listens to using onClick, onMouseDown, etc.*/
