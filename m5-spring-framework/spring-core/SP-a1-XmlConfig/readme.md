## Here are 50 top interview questions and answers related to Spring Framework, covering Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), and many other key concepts.

## 1. What is Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring?
Answer: IoC is a design principle in which the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the application code to the Spring container. It is achieved in Spring using Dependency Injection (DI).
## 2. What is Dependency Injection (DI)?
Answer: DI is a core feature of Spring that allows the Spring container to inject dependencies (e.g., objects) into a class, rather than the class creating the objects itself. It can be done through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.
## 3. What are the types of Dependency Injection in Spring?
Answer:
Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through the class constructor.
Setter Injection: Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into fields (using @Autowired).
## 4. What is a Spring Bean?
Answer: A Spring Bean is an object that is managed by the Spring container. Beans are created, configured, and managed by the Spring IoC container.
## 5. What is the Spring IoC container?
Answer: The IoC container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling beans in a Spring application. It is defined by the interfaces BeanFactory and ApplicationContext.
## 6. What are the different types of Spring IoC containers?
Answer:
BeanFactory: A basic container used in simple applications.
ApplicationContext: A more advanced container, offering additional features like event handling and AOP support.
## 7. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
Answer: BeanFactory is a simpler and more lightweight container, while ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory with additional features like message resources, event propagation, and AOP.
## 8. What are the different scopes available for beans in Spring?
Answer:
Singleton: One instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire Spring container.
Prototype: A new instance is created each time the bean is requested.
Request: A new instance is created for each HTTP request.
Session: A new instance is created for each HTTP session.
Application: A single instance is shared across all servlets in the application.
## 9. What is the @Autowired annotation?
Answer: The @Autowired annotation in Spring is used to autowire dependencies into a class. It can be used for constructor, setter, or field injection.
## 10. What is @Qualifier in Spring?
Answer: @Qualifier is used in conjunction with @Autowired to specify which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type are available in the Spring container.
## 11. What is @Primary annotation in Spring?
Answer: The @Primary annotation is used to mark a bean as the default bean when multiple beans of the same type exist, avoiding the need to use @Qualifier.
## 12. What is the purpose of @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller annotations?
Answer: These annotations are used to mark classes as Spring beans.
@Component: A generic annotation to define a bean.
@Service: Used for service-layer beans.
@Repository: Used for DAO-layer beans, with added persistence features.
@Controller: Used for controller classes in Spring MVC.
## 13. What is the Spring Bean Life Cycle?
Answer: The Spring Bean Life Cycle involves initialization, usage, and destruction. Beans are created by the Spring container, dependencies are injected, initialization methods are called, beans are used, and finally, destruction methods are called when the application context is closed.
## 14. What is @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy in Spring?
Answer:
@PostConstruct: Marks a method to be executed after bean initialization.
@PreDestroy: Marks a method to be executed before bean destruction.
## 15. What is Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)?
Answer: AOP is a programming paradigm used in Spring to separate cross-cutting concerns (such as logging, security) from business logic. It uses aspects, join points, and advice.
## 16. What are some common types of advice in Spring AOP?
Answer:
Before advice: Runs before the target method.
After advice: Runs after the target method.
Around advice: Runs both before and after the target method, can modify the return value.
After-throwing advice: Runs when the target method throws an exception.
After-returning advice: Runs after the target method returns successfully.
## 17. What is Spring Data?
Answer: Spring Data is a framework that simplifies data access, providing repositories and template classes for interacting with different types of databases like JPA, MongoDB, and more.
## 18. What is Spring JDBC?
Answer: Spring JDBC simplifies the usage of JDBC by eliminating boilerplate code like opening/closing connections and error handling, and provides template classes like JdbcTemplate for easy database interaction.
## 19. What is the difference between @RequestMapping and @GetMapping in Spring MVC?
Answer:
@RequestMapping: A general-purpose annotation that can handle all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
@GetMapping: A specialized form of @RequestMapping that handles HTTP GET requests.
## 20. What is the use of @RestController in Spring?
Answer: @RestController is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody, which indicates that the class is a controller that will return JSON or XML responses directly from methods, making it suitable for RESTful APIs.
## 21. What is Spring Boot?
Answer: Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies Spring application development by providing default configurations, embedded servers, and easy-to-use annotations for building stand-alone, production-ready applications.
## 22. What is the difference between Spring Boot and Spring Framework?
Answer: Spring Boot is a part of the Spring Framework that simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring-based applications by providing defaults, embedded servers, and automatic configurations.
## 23. What is application.properties in Spring Boot?
Answer: application.properties is the configuration file in Spring Boot used to configure various application properties like database connections, server settings, logging, and other application-specific settings.
## 24. What is Spring Security?
Answer: Spring Security is a framework for securing Spring applications, providing authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks like CSRF, session fixation, and more.
## 25. What is the use of @EnableAutoConfiguration in Spring Boot?
Answer: @EnableAutoConfiguration is an annotation used in Spring Boot to enable automatic configuration of application components based on the classpath and other conditions.
## 26. What is the difference between @ComponentScan and @Bean?
Answer:
@ComponentScan: Automatically detects and registers beans in the application context from specific packages.
@Bean: Used in Java configuration to explicitly define a Spring bean.
## 27. What is the role of @RequestBody in Spring MVC?
Answer: @RequestBody is used to bind the HTTP request body to a method parameter in a controller. It is commonly used for RESTful services to receive JSON or XML data.
## 28. What is @ResponseBody in Spring?
Answer: @ResponseBody is used to indicate that the return value of a method should be written directly to the HTTP response body, typically used for RESTful services.
## 29. What is the purpose of @Value in Spring?
Answer: @Value is used to inject values into fields, methods, or constructors from external sources like properties files or environment variables.
## 30. What is Spring Batch?
Answer: Spring Batch is a lightweight framework for batch processing in Spring, used to process large volumes of data in a robust and efficient manner.
## 31. What is @Entity in Spring Data JPA?
Answer: @Entity is used to mark a class as a JPA entity that will be persisted in a relational database.
## 32. What is @Table in Spring Data JPA?
Answer: @Table is used to specify the database table name to which an entity is mapped.
## 33. What is @Id in Spring Data JPA?
Answer: @Id is used to denote the primary key field in an entity class.
