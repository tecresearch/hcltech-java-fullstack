🔍 System.out.println() — What Does It Do?
This statement is used to print text to the console in Java. For example:


This prints:

Hello, world!
But behind this simple line is a chain of objects and classes working together. Let's go deep into each part:

🧩 1. System
System is a final class in the java.lang package.
It cannot be instantiated (no new System()).
It provides access to system-level resources like:
Standard input (System.in)
Standard output (System.out)
Standard error (System.err)
Environment variables, system properties, etc.
Key Point:
System is a utility class with static members.

🧩 2. out
out is a static field of the System class.
It is of type PrintStream.

It represents the standard output stream, typically the console.
It is initialized when the JVM starts, like this:

So when you write System.out, you're accessing a PrintStream object that knows how to write to the console.

🧩 3. println()
println() is a method of the PrintStream class.
It prints the argument passed to it and then adds a newline character.
There are multiple overloaded versions of println():


Each version converts the argument to a string and writes it to the output stream.

🔄 How It All Connects
When you write:


Here's what happens:

System gives access to the static out field.
out is a PrintStream object connected to the console.
println("Hello") is called on that PrintStream object.
The string "Hello" is printed to the console, followed by a newline.
🧠 Bonus: Can You Customize System.out?
Yes! You can redirect output to a file or another stream:
PrintStream fileOut = new PrintStream("output.txt");
System.setOut(fileOut);
System.out.println("This goes to a file!");
