Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Java has several types of operators, and I'll explain them with examples.

ðŸ§® Types of Operators in Java
1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic mathematical operations.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	a + b
-	Subtraction	a - b
*	Multiplication	a * b
/	Division	a / b
%	Modulus (remainder)	a % b

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
Used to compare two values.

Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to	a == b
!=	Not equal to	a != b
>	Greater than	a > b
<	Less than	a < b
>=	Greater than or equal to	a >= b
<=	Less than or equal to	a <= b

3. Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions.

Operator	Description	Example
&&	Logical AND	a > b && b > c
`		`
!	Logical NOT	!(a > b)

4. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Description	Example
=	Assign	a = 5
+=	Add and assign	a += 3 (same as a = a + 3)
-=	Subtract and assign	a -= 2
*=	Multiply and assign	a *= 4
/=	Divide and assign	a /= 2
%=	Modulus and assign	a %= 3
5. Unary Operators
Operate on a single operand.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Unary plus	+a
-	Unary minus	-a
++	Increment	a++ or ++a
--	Decrement	a-- or --a
!	Logical NOT	!true
6. Bitwise Operators
Operate on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

Operator	Description	Example
&	Bitwise AND	a & b
`	`	Bitwise OR
^	Bitwise XOR	a ^ b
~	Bitwise Complement	~a
<<	Left shift	a << 2
>>	Right shift	a >> 2
