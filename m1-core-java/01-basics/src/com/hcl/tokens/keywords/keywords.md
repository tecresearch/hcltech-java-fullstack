In Java, keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language syntax. These cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, class names, etc.). Here's a list of commonly used Java keywords:

ðŸ”¹ Control Flow Keywords

default
while
do
for
break
continue
return
ðŸ”¹ Access Modifiers

double
char
boolean
byte
short
long
void
ðŸ”¹ Exception Handling

volatile
ðŸ”¹ Other Keywords

ðŸ”¹ Reserved but Not Used
goto
const


ðŸ”¹ Data Type Keywords
Java provides several keywords to define the type of data a variable can hold. These include int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, and long. Each of these represents a primitive data type. For example, int is used for integers, double for decimal numbers with double precision, and boolean for true/false values.

ðŸ”¹ Control Flow Keywords
To manage the flow of execution, Java uses keywords like if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue, and return. These allow you to make decisions (if/else), loop through data (for, while, do), exit loops early (break), skip iterations (continue), and return values from methods (return).

ðŸ”¹ Access Modifiers
Java uses public, private, and protected to control access to classes, methods, and variables. public means accessible from anywhere, private restricts access to within the class, and protected allows access within the same package or subclasses.

ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Programming Keywords
Java is an object-oriented language, and keywords like class, interface, extends, implements, new, this, and super are central to its design. You use class to define a blueprint, interface to define a contract, extends to inherit from a class, and implements to fulfill an interface. The new keyword creates objects, this refers to the current object, and super refers to the parent class.

ðŸ”¹ Exception Handling Keywords
To handle errors gracefully, Java provides try, catch, finally, throw, and throws. You wrap risky code in a try block, handle exceptions in catch, and use finally for cleanup. throw is used to manually throw an exception, and throws declares exceptions a method might throw.

ðŸ”¹ Class Behavior Modifiers
Java allows you to modify how classes and methods behave using keywords like abstract, final, static, synchronized, volatile, transient, native, and strictfp. For instance, abstract defines incomplete classes or methods, final prevents inheritance or overriding, and static makes a member belong to the class rather than an instance. synchronized and volatile are used in multithreading, while transient prevents serialization of fields. native links to non-Java code, and strictfp ensures consistent floating-point calculations.

ðŸ”¹ Other Useful Keywords
Java also includes package and import for organizing and using code from other files. instanceof checks object types, enum defines a fixed set of constants, and assert is used for debugging.

ðŸ”¹ Reserved but Not Used
Java reserves goto and const, but they are not used in the language. They exist to prevent conflicts with other languages or future extensions



Letâ€™s go deeper into Java keywordsâ€”understanding their purpose, usage, and categories. Java has 50+ reserved keywords, each serving a specific role in the language. Here's a structured breakdown:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Type Keywords
These define the type of data a variable can hold.

Keyword	Description
int	Integer type
float	Floating-point number
double	Double-precision floating point
char	Single character
boolean	True/false values
byte	8-bit integer
short	16-bit integer
long	64-bit integer
ðŸ”¹ 2. Control Flow Keywords
Used to control the execution flow of the program.

Keyword	Description
if	Conditional execution
else	Alternative execution
switch	Multi-way branching
case	Defines a branch in switch
default	Default case in switch
while	Loop with condition
do	Loop that runs at least once
for	Loop with initialization
break	Exit loop or switch
continue	Skip current loop iteration
return	Exit from method and return value
ðŸ”¹ 3. Access Modifiers
Control visibility of classes, methods, and variables.

Keyword	Description
public	Accessible from anywhere
private	Accessible only within class
protected	Accessible within package/subclass
default	(no keyword) package-private
ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Keywords
Used for class and object structure.

Keyword	Description
class	Declares a class
interface	Declares an interface
extends	Inherits a class
implements	Implements an interface
new	Creates an object
this	Refers to current object
super	Refers to parent class
ðŸ”¹ Exception Handling Keywords
Used to manage errors and exceptions.

Keyword	Description
try	Block to test for errors
catch	Handles exceptions
finally	Executes after try/catch
throw	Throws an exception
throws	Declares exceptions a method may throw
ðŸ”¹ Class Behavior Modifiers
Control how classes and methods behave.

Keyword	Description
abstract	Declares abstract class/method
final	Prevents inheritance/override
static	Belongs to class, not instance
synchronized	Controls thread access
volatile	Ensures visibility in threads
transient	Prevents serialization
native	Indicates native method
strictfp	Enforces floating-point precision
ðŸ”¹ Other Keywords
Keyword	Description
package	Declares a package
import	Imports other packages/classes
instanceof	Tests object type
enum	Declares an enumeration
assert	Used for debugging
ðŸ”¹ Reserved but Unused
Keyword	Description
goto	Reserved, not used
const	Reserved, not used
