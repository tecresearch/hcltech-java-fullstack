In Java, tokens are the smallest elements of a program that are meaningful to the compiler. When you write Java code, the compiler breaks it down into these tokens during the lexical analysis phase of compilation.

Types of Tokens in Java
Here are the main types of tokens in Java:

Keywords
Reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language.
Examples: class, public, static, if, else, while, return, etc.

Identifiers
Names given to variables, classes, methods, etc.
Example: myVariable, Student, calculateSum

Literals
Constant values assigned to variables.
Examples:

Integer: 10, -5
Floating-point: 3.14, -0.01
Character: 'a', 'Z'
String: "Hello", "Java"
Boolean: true, false
Operators
Symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
Examples: +, -, *, /, =, ==, &&, ||, ++, --

Separators (or Delimiters)
Characters that separate tokens.
Examples: (), {}, [], ;, ,, .

Comments
Not technically tokens, but ignored by the compiler.

Single-line: // comment
Multi-line: /* comment */
