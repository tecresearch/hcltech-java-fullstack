In Java, literals are fixed values that are directly represented in the source code. They are used to assign values to variables or constants. Java supports several types of literals, categorized by their data types:

1. Integer Literals
Used for whole numbers.

Decimal (base 10): int x = 100;
Octal (base 8): int y = 0123; // starts with 0
Hexadecimal (base 16): int z = 0x1A3F; // starts with 0x or 0X
Binary (base 2): int b = 0b1010; // starts with 0b or 0B
2. Floating-Point Literals
Used for decimal numbers.

Double (default): double d = 3.14;
Float: float f = 3.14f; // must end with f or F
3. Character Literals
Represent a single character enclosed in single quotes.


4. String Literals
A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.


5. Boolean Literals
Only two possible values:


6. Null Literal
Used to indicate that a reference does not point to any object.
