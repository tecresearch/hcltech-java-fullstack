🔍 What Is an Identifier?
In Java, an identifier is the name used to uniquely identify a program element. These elements include:

Variables
Methods
Classes
Interfaces
Packages
Enums
Annotations
Identifiers are not values—they are labels that refer to memory locations or code blocks.

🧠 How Java Parses Identifiers
When Java code is compiled, the compiler uses identifiers to:

Resolve references to variables and methods
Link method calls to their definitions
Manage scope and visibility
Generate bytecode with symbolic names
Identifiers are stored in the symbol table during compilation, which helps the compiler track their usage and scope.

📜 Syntax Rules for Identifiers
Java follows strict rules for what constitutes a valid identifier:

Rule	Description	Example
Must start with a letter, _, or $	Cannot start with a digit	name, _temp, $value
Can contain letters, digits, _, $	No special characters like @, #, -	user1, data_set
Cannot be a reserved keyword	Keywords like class, int, if are disallowed	❌ class, ✅ className
Case-sensitive	Name ≠ name	User and user are different
🧭 Naming Conventions (Best Practices)
Java has widely accepted naming conventions that improve readability and maintainability:

✅ Variables and Methods
Use camelCase
Start with a lowercase letter
Example: totalAmount, calculateInterest
✅ Classes and Interfaces
Use PascalCase
Start with an uppercase letter
Example: BankAccount, UserService
✅ Constants
Use UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
Example: MAX_SIZE, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
✅ Packages
Use lowercase, often with domain-style naming
Example: com.example.myapp
⚠️ Common Mistakes
Using keywords as identifiers:


Starting with a digit:


Using special characters:


Confusing case sensitivity:

🧩 Advanced Concepts
1. Shadowing
When a local variable has the same name as a class-level variable:


2. Scope Resolution
Identifiers are resolved based on their scope:

Local
Instance
Class
Package
